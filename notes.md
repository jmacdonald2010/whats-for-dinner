Random meal works on first button push. Does not work on subsequent presses.

I don't think I commited prior to the DB write update. Going to do that now that it is actually working.

Made significant progress on the popup window. Working on database writing.

Merging to main since I managed to get the app to actually display things.

Unsure of why I can't get the screen to display anything. May try placing the grid layout into its own class (widget) and just using the app class to build. Likely will involve a new branch just to be safe.

Initial commit. Getting a black screen when running the app.
